  <h1>The Beach (2000)</h1>
  <time datetime=2023-09-12T11:55:40&#43;0300 class="post-date">Tue, Sep 12, 2023</time>
  <p><em>The Beach</em> is a 2000 adaptation of Alex Garland&rsquo;s (of <em>Ex Machina</em> and <em>Annihilation</em> fame) 1996 debut novel with the same title, directed by Danny Boyle. Starring a young Leonardo DiCaprio, Tilda Swinton, and Robert Carlyle in a short but memorable role, it is a film often overlooked, but reflective of its era, the late-90&rsquo;s, the era of the end of history, where the greatest threat to the new post-ideological man is ennui. The film is set in Thailand and tackles the subject of what was then already a tired cliche: the community of Western backpackers exploring &ldquo;the east&rdquo; to &ldquo;find themselves&rdquo;, or whatever. The way it explores this subject matter is neither particularly original or revolutionary, yet it reveals a particularly poingnant insight into the deeper conservatism of the current neoliberal order&rsquo;s commodification of self-actualisation, and the impossibility of escape.</p>
<p>In the film, Richard is travelling solo through Thailand when he books into a cheap motel in Bangkok, meeting multiple other young westerners among whom Francoise, a young French woman he becomes infatuated with, her boyfriend Etienne, and Bugs, a deranged Scot spinning incoherent yarns. Richard is disgusted by the transactional and inauthentic nature, as well as the excess of the Thai tourism sector aimed at Westerners, and in this he clicks with Bugs, who shows him a map that will supposedly take him to a remote island paradise with a hidden beach, free of tourists. Bugs is found dead by suicide the next morning, traumatising Richard and motivating him to search for the beach.</p>
<p>Of course the irony is that the thought does not occur to Richard that he represents precisely the tourists he is trying to get away from. This reveals a fundamental contradiction in the neoliberal cult of the self: we are sold authenticity, but our subjection to the market only allows us to be authentic in the few set ways that the market allows. Which means everyone can live authentically in precisely the same ways as everyone else, narcissistically oblivious to the true conformism of this, because in their case, they are convinced that &ldquo;it&rsquo;s for real&rdquo;.</p>
<p>After a lengthy trip in which he also involves the French couple, Richard manages to ultimately swim to the island, where they hide from armed guards tending to a large marijuana plantation. Beyond the jungle and a waterfall lies the beach promised by Bugs: a picturesque, pristine white sand beach hidden from view from the ocean by a rock formation. On the beach lives a post-hippie commune, formed exclusively by westerners, led by Sal, who are less than welcoming towards the trio, worried that newcomers will attract the attention of the armed marijuana farmers, but they are ultimately accepted and integrate into the commune.</p>
<p>There, Richard first lives a life of carefree joy, practicing sports, fishing, and even getting toghether with Francoise. But the dark side of the community soon becomes apparent. Medical issues, inclement weather, spoiled rice, shark attacks and tensions with the marijuana farmers all threaten the existence of the commune. Sal is adamant on covert-authoritarian control over these issues, preferring to ignore them so the commune can continue pursuing their leisurely lifestyle. A particularly gruesome example of this is when a Swedish fisherman is badly injured during a shark attack. In order to not perturb the partying and good mood of the community with his screams and grunts of agony, the Swede is taken to a tent in the forest and left there in the hopes he will die. But Etienne nurses him and he survives, his agony prolonged, much to the chagrin of the greater community.</p>
<p>After tensions arise between the community, Sal, and Richard because of his actions which drew another group of backpackers to the island, he is assigned to watch them and ensure they pose no threat. In what is essentially a retelling of the Buddhist myth of Gautama Buddha, Richard rejects both the life in the pursuit of pleasure (the hedonistic life) and the base life of a beast (in his existence in the hills as a sentinel exiled by Sal). His confusion regarding his relationship to the commune, from which he was essentially exiled and alienated from, results in him hallucinating and conversing with the dead Bugs, who, like Lord Krishna in the story, provides clues as to the real nature of his situation. Richard imagines that Bugs also grew disillusioned with the commune, but could not return to the tourist life on the mainland. He thinks Bugs could not deal with this contradiction, succumbing to despair and suicide.</p>
<p>This dialectical move to a new position, beyond the cliched search for authenticity in the pursuit of exotic pleasures (yet, paradoxically, in the company of Westerners only) and the base existence of mere survival, is allowed only through the slaughter of many people, namely the Swedes in the first phase, and the American backpackers in the second, who are executed by the drug dealers after a shootout erupts.</p>
<p>The commune&rsquo;s situation reveals the capitalist realist ambivalence towards utopia, at the same time which it reveals the deeper conservatism of the story. It is clear that the post-liberal utopia of the commune can exist only as a side-effect of organised crime. The commune is allowed to exist by the drug dealers who make their money from selling marijuana to the very tourists the commune formed to escape from in the first place. The post-ideological utopia created by Sal is undercut by its very own dismissal of the material conditions of its existence. This disavowal is characteristic of the neoliberal phase of capitalist culture.</p>
<p>At the same time, the moral horror of the film is evident in its explicit illustration of utilitarianism. The one ailing Swede is left to suffer unbelievable torture in the forest, while the rest are partying, sunbathing and playing sports. His death is part of a similarly utilitarian plot, to allow the initial trio finally to finally escape the commune. But far from being a dispassionate calculation on the part of Sal or Richard, the utilitarian calculus is here a result of the narcissistic obsession with the authentic self; the commune&rsquo;s journey of self-discovery cannot be derailed by the agonised screams of one who was hitherto a fellow communard. This shows the degradation of social ties under conditions of the late capitalist order; friends and family are totally dispensable if they threaten the fragile, constructed, ideal self.</p>
<p>The end is deliciously ironic. In a passage that can be interpreted as either an anticolonial speech or precisely the subversion of such, the commune is invaded by the marijuana farmers, while the lead drug dealer tells the communards to go home and forget about Thailand. That he does the drug dealing to feed his family. It is only fitting that Sal, a brit, tells him, in the great British tradition of Empire: no. This is our home! We built it! And despite her previous &ldquo;progressive&rdquo; committments, she picks up a gun and does her &ldquo;justice&rdquo; by executing Richard.</p>
<p>Only as in real-life geopolitical games, this too was a game of Russian roulette. The gun was not loaded. The very show of force, if unconvincing, demonstrates precisely a lack of strength. The result is that the communards all leave. Who is the winner in all this? Is it the farmer-turned-drug dealer, who had little choice but to turn to crime in order to connect to the global flows of capital? The fate of the all-white utopia in Thailand turned out to be another failure. As Richard says: the commune had &ldquo;no ideology, nothing like that&rdquo;. But that left room for the default, invisible ideology that permeates late capitalist culture, the century of the self. But the self cannot maintain or dissolve communes. Men with guns, bought with the produce of the marijuana fields, on the other hand, can.</p>
<p>Fittingly, Richard is then shown in the afterlife of his orientalist fever dream of Thailand: he is sitting at a computer desk in Silicon Valley. In the 90&rsquo;s, this kind of coda to a shaggy dog tale could have seeemed believable. Today, it strikes me as particularly dates &ndash; it truly looks like an apotheosis of the dream of middle class self-actualisation. We go to Thailand to find enlightenment; then, once enlightened, we dispassionately but ruthlessly pursue the capitalist goal of endless accumulation. Is this not the too often-retold hagiography of characters like Steve Jobs?</p>
<p>The idea that paradise can be found not on the beaches of Thailand but rather in the fortunes of the dotcom boom seems ludicrous today (even though we delude ourselves into thinking otherwise with the likes of AI, Web 3.0, etc.). It is telling that the scars Richard bears are a kind of rite of passage &ndash; the whole ordeal, a good story to tell, a picture taken on the beach, an attachment to an email from an old girlfriend. The pursuit of authenticity and self-actualisation is moved from the East to the digital world, which was at the point of the film&rsquo;s production already in the process of enclosure and at the start of the process of primitive accumulation.</p>
<p>The film is best seen as reflective of a specific era in which the yearning for a different world (remember the anti-Globalisation slogan, &ldquo;a different world is possible&rdquo;?) and the struggle for a better tomorrow in the wake of the fall of historical communism and the &ldquo;end of history&rdquo; were increasingly subsumed into a lucrative industry of the self. It also reminds us that this culture of narcissism into which we find ourselves immersed did not originate or really have anything to do with social media; rather, social media emerged as a new means of communication that took hold precisely because it increased the efficiency of what we were already doing.</p>
<p>What conclusion is there to draw? One would be that the pursuit of self-actualisation and authenticity need not be at odds with strong communal links. In fact, it is clear to me that the only authentic existence is the one where meaningful, bivalent connections to one&rsquo;s neighbours exist in the form of meaningful relationships based on a shared existence, projects, and material struggles. Notice also that the commune was happiest when working together; and brought low by prioritising the private pleasures rather than the common interest. Another possible interpretation is that the commune was never a community at all, but rather a collection of private individuals each using the others to live out their fantasy. Whichever way we look at it, this film has something to teach us about where we are comung from and perhaps even sketches out ways to overcome our predicaments.</p>
