  <p>On the Romanian scene, enter Calin Georgescu, member of the Club of Rome and AUR&rsquo;s proposal for the role of Prime Minister. To say he is a contradictory and mysterious figure would be an understatement. While he is a virtual unknown in Romanian politics, having worked only in more behind-the-scenes roles, he has for years been the chosen prime minister of all sorts of non-parliamentary far-right parties. He appears to endorse the notion of &ldquo;sustainable development&rdquo;, having studied and written about the subject extensively, yet his approach seems little more than a vulgar form of Catholic distributism. He is a Western-educated technocrat more in line with the style of, perhaps, the USR, yet appears, in discourse at least, to be little removed from the pompous self-importance of the underground neo-Fascist movements that even AUR distanced themselves from in the past [8]. He has been paraded around as a serious player by AUR, but he seems unaccustomed to appearing in the media, constantly committing what I can only see as strategic blunders seemingly obliviously, and has quite an ambiguous relationship to the party, being, at the moment, the object of what to me seems like a power struggle between the co-presidents Simion and Tarziu [9]. Finally, despite popular opinion in Romania being largely anti-Russian, due to deep-seated traumas and generational memories from the rather needlessly brutal occupation by the Red Army in 1945, he is openly identifying as aligned with Russia, seeing it as a natural Eurasian partner of Romania. One can only speculate how far that relationship goes &ndash; suffice it to say that in 2015 he boasted on TV that he &ldquo;categorically knows Alexandr Dugin&rdquo; [10]. In the same interview he also claimed to know Pat Buchanan and praised him as one of the &ldquo;immense minds&rdquo; of America.</p>
<p>While his buffoonish emulation of late National-Communist ultranationalism might come across as out of touch with more cleaned-up versions such as the liberal-conservative discourses of the Basescu and Ponta years, it is indeed an indication that heightened emotion is oftentimes sufficient to provoke a significant response. It seems to me that the more explicit association of Georgescu with AUR is an attempt at legitimation</p>
<p>Lastly, I would argue that distributism (and, to a lesser degree, libertarianism and anarcho-capitalism) are degenerate forms of utopian socialism. They are utopian in that they build their arguments and normative practices on abstract first principles such as Christian morality in the case of the former and liberal social contract theory in the case of the latter, and wish to transform society based on these irrespective of historical and material conditions. They are &ldquo;socialist&rdquo; (and here I am sure I can be contradicted) insofar as they focus on society as a whole and explicitly consider the well-being of the social unit (although here they define well-being and the social unit very differently between different schools, and very differently from how I would define it). They are degenerate in the sense that while they lay claim to being completely new social arrangements, they copy many ideas from historical utopian socialism while rejecting any historical association or theoretical engagement with other socialist schools and they explicitly stand against the left, rejecting a holistic understanding of social dynamics and relations (such as Marxism) and presupposing bourgeois social relations as immutable.</p>
<p>Thus they, in fact, become companions and precursors to a kind of a &ldquo;Fascism with a human face&rdquo; &ndash; an ideology well suited for demagoguery and populist discourse. We will make <em>everyone</em> a small capitalist! Doesn&rsquo;t that sound great? That will surely break the rule of monopolistic banks and corporations. By establishing a way towards the <em>ideal</em> form of capitalism, that of universal participation to the market, such ideologies exploit established biases in the capitalist subject, such as the hope for social mobility. Yet in reality, without massive state intervention, in a few years, the dream of distributist equality would result in the same monopolistic distribution there exists now. In fact, an analogous process happened after 1989 when formerly socialised agricultural lands were privatised, being distributed among the individual farmers. A few well-connected farmers accumulated massive estates, while a great majority of the rural population quickly became landless again.</p>
<p>So we cannot take such policy suggestions seriously &ndash; if they are made in good faith at all, then the result will at most be a modest wealth redistribution scheme or land reform, while the underlying social relations remain unchanged due to its perpetuation of class society &ndash; and a return to semi-feudal relations at worst.</p>
