  <p>Anticommunism and pro usa
The entire historical political ezperience of communism, of the previous generation, is thrown away as irrelevant, nostalgic and a step backward
The communist legacy has to be subjected to a thorough historical analysis, not as a mobolithic xxz. The communist period has to be seen as a whole - both good and bad. We must continue such a project, and I am truly happy that in the academic world this is indeed already well underway by scholars such as Iovanel and xxx. Similar projects are being engendered for the former Yugoslavia and xxx. Already in this movement of young researchers we can see a distancing from the highly ideological first generation of commenters on communism (for in no way can they be seen as serious researchers, but more like shills for the postcommunist regimes and for the instauration of US hegemony)
Anticommunist criticism only from the right - we must have a powerful criticism of actually existing socialism in Romania from the left also. We can start by critiquing its state fetishism, its adoption of the soviet model without adapting it to prevailing material conditions, its imposition as a colonial regime from the soviet core, its authoritarianism and xxx. Moreover we can add to the Ceausescu regime the criticism of a revived chauvinistic nationalism, social conservatism and para-neoloberalism (the obsession with a balanced budget, the obsession with &ldquo;rentability&rdquo; of state enterprises which is akin to profitability) and so on and so forth. It os obvious to me that it was not communism that brought down the regime - it was austerity.</p>
