      <description>Perhaps it is tempting to sneer at anti intellectual conspiracy peddling as fundamentally stupid but it does present a genuinely interesting epistemological problem in addition to the practical ones of how to approach someone who literally lives in a different world from you.
Maybe the attraction to dogmatic thinking is a measure of tiredness with postmodernity, in which micro-&amp;ldquo;grand narratives&amp;rdquo; are constantly shifted, morphed, spliced then discarded (think of stuff like self-help, motivational speakers or &amp;ldquo;financial education&amp;rdquo; on the socially-accepted end, Western Buddhism, New Age and Richard Dawkins-esque cultish Atheism somewhere in the middle, and conspiracy theories and the like on the extreme end).</description>
